  <h4 class="ng-binding">Why can't I wager more BTC?</h4>
  <br>
  <p class="ng-binding">The maximum bet is automatically adjusted by the system, according to the number of players playing concurrently, and the wager size for each individual player. Because there is only a limited pool of funds to back bets, if the system determines that the amount of bets placed has exceeded the immediate repayment capacity of the system - which can only be determined after a bet is placed but before spinning the circle - upon pressing the Bitcoin to spin the circle, the amount wagered will be automatically returned to the players balance before evaluating for win or loss. The maximum allowed bet value is adjusted in real time, so you can try to bet again in a few minutes.</p><p></p>
  <br>
  <h4 class="ng-binding">Is there a minimum wager per spin?</h4>
  <br>
  <p class="ng-binding">Nope, play with as little Bitcoins as you like, but know that the more your wager the more reward points you'll receive.</p><p></p>
  <br>
  <h4 class="ng-binding">How many confirmations do I have to wait for  before I can withdraw my balance?</h4>
  <br>
  <p class="ng-binding">To ensure a stable and safe playing environment for our players, and prevent potential abuse, we have the following tiered withdrawal policy in place:</p><p></p>
  <ul><li>Winnings from the initial deposits below 0.1BTC: 2 confirmations</li>
  <li>Winnings from the initial deposits in the range of 0.1BTC - 1BTC: 3 confirmation</li><li>
  Winnings from the initial deposits in the range of 1BTC - 10BTC: 4 confirmations</li><li>
  Winnings from the initial deposits in the range of 10BTC - 100BTC: 5 confirmations</li><li>
  Winnings from the initial deposits above 100BTC: 6 confirmations</li></ul>
  <br>
  <h4 class="ng-binding">Why isn't my deposit showing up in the balance?</h4>
  <br>
  <p class="ng-binding">Your deposit should show up within seconds of you sending it to your personal deposit address. If it doesn't, please try refreshing the page and starting your game over again, or contact us. We've yet to encounter a situation where the deposits don't appear.</p><p></p>
